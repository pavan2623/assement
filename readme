Receipt Processor

This project is a web service that processes receipts and calculates reward points based on a set of business rules. It is built using Java and Spring Boot and is containerized with Docker. The application provides two main endpoints:

POST /receipts/process – Accepts a receipt in JSON format, calculates points, and returns an ID.
GET /receipts/{id}/points – Returns the points awarded for a receipt given its ID.
Features

Points Calculation:
Points are calculated based on the following rules:
1 point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
50 points if the total is a round dollar amount (no cents).
25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.
5 points for every two items on the receipt.
For each item, if the trimmed item description’s length is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer; the result is added as points.
A special bonus of 5 points is added if the total is greater than 10.00.
6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
10 points if the purchase time is between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM.
